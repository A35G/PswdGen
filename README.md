PswdGen
=======

Codename *PassGen*, is a simple PHP script that allows you to generate passwords by combining:

* **Capital letters**
* **Lowercase letters**
* **Numeric characters**
* **Symbols**

### PHP Password Generator - Changelog

* vers. 0.1.11 - *Oct 2013* - __Testing period__

Create indipendent localization and fixed little bugs

* vers. 0.1 - *June/July 2012*

Currently, the items are fixed and localized in *Italian*; the next update will include integration into the code, to make independent localization.  
The length of password, currently, is fixed at 12 character.

### More Info

I have wanted to share with all this script, born for personal use, because it might be useful to someone, or simply could be improved.  
Any advice and/or suggestion is welcome.
