PswdGen
=======

Codename *PassGen*, is a simple PHP script that allows you to generate passwords by combining:

* **Capital letters**
* **Lowercase letters**
* **Numeric characters**
* **Symbols**

Currently, the items are fixed and localized in *Italian*.
The next update will include integration into the code, to make independent localization.
